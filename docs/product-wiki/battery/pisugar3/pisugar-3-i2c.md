# PiSugar3 I2C Datasheet

   **Register address:**

   0x57
![I2C address table](https://cdn.pisugar.com/img/I2Ctable.png)

* In the I2C register, the retention bit is reserved for the system test interface and it is forbidden to write the data.
* When directly modifying the I2C register, you need to read the value of the corresponding register first. Write the calculated value into this register after performing AND operation on the BIT bits that need to be modified. At the same time, make sure that only the bits that need to be modified are modified, and the values of other bits cannot be modified at will.

## Function specifications
PiSugar 3 has many advanced power functions that can be set up, which are described below.

Some functions can be operated on WebUI, indicating that this function does not need to be manually set up by I2C, only in WebUI. At the same time, the WebUI interface can be set up directly through the command line. The function set through the WebUI will retain the settings  in the Raspberry Pi system and will not be set to the default value after restart or battery reset.

1. Write Protection

   **Register address:**

   Write protection: 0x0B

   **Register operation:**

   can be read or written

   **Operating instructions:**

   When reading, 1 indicates that the PiSugar registers can be written, 0 indicates that the registers cannot be written.
   
   Writing 0x29 to this register will make other registers writable, and writing any other value (such as 0xff) will make other register unwritable
   
   The following functions are not affected by write protection
   Reading data.

   Feed watchdog

   TAP Button State Cleanup

   **Minimum firmware version: 1.2.4**

1. External power supply detection

   **Register address:**

   the 7th bit of the 0X02 address

   **Register operation:**

   can be read or written

   **Data description:**

   1 means external power supply access, 0 means no external power supply

   **Function description:**

   It can be judged whether the external power supply is connected by querying the 7th bit of the 0X02 address. The detection is to detect whether the power input interface has voltage. If the plug is inserted but there is no power supply, it will be detected that the external power supply is not connected.

   WebUI supports reading the status.

1. Charging switch

   **Register address:**

   the 6th bit of the 0X02 address

   **Register operation:**

   can be read or written

   **WebUI does not support this function.**

1. Software watchdog

   **Register address:**

   The function switch: the 7th bit of the 0X06 address, the watchdog reset: the 5th bit of the 0x06 address, the watchdog interval time: the 0x07 address.

   **Register operation:**

   can be read or written.

   **Data description:**

   1 is on, 0 is off.

   Writing 1 on the watchdog reset setting bit will reset the watchdog timer (kicking the dog).

   The watchdog delay is set to the register value X 2s, for example, when the register value is 0x05, the actual watchdog delay is 5X2s=10s.

   **Function description:**

   The software watchdog provides a watchdog other than the Raspberry Pi system, which restarts the Raspberry Pi system when the Raspberry Pi system crashes. When this function is turned on, if the watchdog timer is not reset (kicking the dog) within the software watchdog time interval, PiSugar will temporarily turn off the output to achieve the purpose of restarting the Raspberry Pi system. The operation of kicking the dog needs to be completed by the user.

   **default value:**

   This function is off by default. It is off by default each time it restarts.

   **WebUI does not support this function.**

   **Operation example:**

1. Custom I2C address
   
   **Register address:**

   0x50

   **Register operation:**

   can be read or written.

   **Data description:**

   the highest bit is even parity check bit. If the number of 1 in the data is odd, the highest bit is 1, otherwise it is 0

   For example, if the data is 0x57, the binary representation is 0b010110111, and the count of 1 is 5, so the highest bit is 1, and the final date is 0xd7, the binary representation is 0b11010111

   **Function description:**

   Changing this register will change the operation address of I2C (0x57 by default). The change takes effect immediately.

   The I2C address range is 0x03-0x77. If date beyond the range, it will not be written successfully.

   **Default value**

   0xd7 (actual address 0x57). This value will not be reset whether turned off or reset the system. So if you want change it, make sure you know what are you doing.


   **WebUI not supports this function**

   If you want to change the I2C address of WebUI, you can modify i2c_addr of /etc/pisugar-server/config.json

   If the i2c_addr isn't in your file, you can add it.

   For example, the address is 0x30:
   "i2c_addr"= 48,
