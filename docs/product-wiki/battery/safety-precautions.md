## Charging Precautions

For safety and battery longevity, follow these guidelines during charging:

1. **Charger Voltage**: MUST use a standard USB power adapter with 5V output. Do NOT use chargers with output voltage exceeding 5V, especially those supporting fast-charge protocols that do not automatically step down to 5V.
2. **Fast-Charge Risk**: If using a power adapter supporting fast-charge protocols, ensure its output voltage remains 5V when connected to PiSugar. PiSugar is NOT responsible for damage or accidents caused by excessive fast-charge voltage.
3. **Charging Environment**: Charge in a well-ventilated area. Ensure no flammable materials are nearby. Place the device on non-combustible surfaces like tile or concrete.
4. **Avoid High Temp Charging**: Ambient temperatures above 40°C severely impact battery life. Excessive heat (e.g., direct sunlight, inside a closed vehicle) can cause swelling, fire, or explosion.
5. **Prevent Heat Buildup**: The device generates heat during charging. Do NOT hold it while charging or place it in enclosed containers (e.g., bags, drawers, 3D printed cases). Heat buildup can cause safety risks.
6. **Full Charge Stop**: PiSugar has built-in overcharge protection and stops charging automatically when full. For enhanced safety, manually disconnect the charger after a full charge.
7. **Do Not Overcharge**: Do NOT force continuous charging by any means. Overcharging damages cell structure, causing swelling or fire.

## Storage and Transportation Precautions

To prevent performance degradation or accidents, follow these rules during storage and transportation:

1. **Keep Away from Children**: Store batteries in a secure location out of children's reach. If small parts are swallowed, seek medical help immediately.
2. **Avoid High Temperatures**: NEVER store batteries in high-temperature areas (e.g., direct sunlight, closed vehicles, near fire sources or heaters). Ideal storage temperature is 22°C~28°C.
3. **Keep Dry & Ventilated**: Store batteries in a dry, well-ventilated place. Avoid damp or potentially water-leaking environments.
4. **Prevent Physical Damage**: Do NOT crush, pierce, or impact batteries. Do NOT reuse batteries after severe impact.
5. **Avoid Metal Contact**: Do NOT store or transport batteries mixed with metal items (e.g., keys, coins, necklaces, hairpins) to prevent short circuits.
6. **Do Not Transport Damaged Batteries**: If a battery leaks, swells, or is damaged, do NOT transport it. Hand it over to professionals for disposal.
7. **Reduce Charge Before Transport**: Before transporting batteries, discharge them to below 30% to reduce risk.
